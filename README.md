## 📋 Project Overview

**Project Type:** Infrastructure Deployment & Identity Management  
**Status:** Complete and Fully Operational  
**Business Use Case:** Centralized identity, authentication, and access management in a cloud-hosted environment  

This project demonstrates the deployment of a traditional **on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** environment hosted entirely within **Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines**. The goal was to simulate a real-world enterprise identity infrastructure while leveraging cloud-based compute resources.

The implementation includes provisioning Azure VMs, promoting a Windows Server to a domain controller, configuring domain services, and validating authentication and domain join functionality for client machines.

This project is designed as a **portfolio-ready example** of enterprise identity and access management fundamentals.

## 🖥️ Environments & Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
- Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)
- Windows 11 (Domain-Joined Client)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- PowerShell (administration & validation)

---

## ⚙️ High-Level Deployment Steps

1. Provisioned Azure virtual machines for domain controller and client systems  
2. Installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services  
3. Promoted Windows Server to a domain controller  
4. Joined client machine to the domain  
5. Validated authentication, directory services, and policy application
